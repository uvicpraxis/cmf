<p>Making records with media is now quite familiar, as audio, image, and text files function routinely as evidence. “I was there.” “I saw this.” “I heard that.” “I completed the form.” “I submit to you Exhibit A.” From this perspective, media are traces of otherwise ephemeral events: they help people point to the past, keep it found, track it, study it, circulate it, comment on it, and even leverage it. Yet media are not just files. They are practices, too, often entwined with the language of seizure and extraction. <em>Take</em> a video. <em>Capture</em> some audio. <em>Search</em> for text. <em>Grab</em> the image before it’s gone. And, of course, they (plural) are used by the media (singular) to report news around the world.</p>
<p>Media are everywhere, and knowing how and why records are made with them is incredibly important today. They are fundamental to how people relate. They are also history machines: they correspond with the past and play a pivotal role in reproducing it. They should not, however, be reduced to matters of evidence and extraction alone, hence the title of this book, which makes room for fiction at the media table.</p>
<p><em>Contemporary Media and Fiction</em> is an open-access textbook for undergraduate students who are interested in the intersections of audio, image, text, and Anglophone fiction since 2000. What do people imagine with media? How do audio, images, and text tell stories on their own and together? How is fiction read but also watched, played, seen, and heard? How does action itself become a medium? With such questions in mind, the following chapters engage comics, games, podcasts, short stories, novels, and more. In each case, media are snapshots of history <em>and</em> sites of conjecture—information as well as communication; not seized or extracted, but designed and composed; not only documenting what happened, but speculating what did or could.</p>
<p>Records are made and so, too, are fictions.</p>

<p>Before you begin this chapter, you will need access to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html"><em>M00D 0F THE M0MENT</em></a> (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries;<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent"><em>Secrets Agent</em></a> (2014), by Marina Kittaka;</li>
<li>A text editor, such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>; and,</li>
<li>If you wish, the ZIP archive (coming soon) <!-- chapter1Audio.zip -->of this chapter’s audio downloaded to your computer. This way, you will not need to listen to the book in your web browser. To facilitate listening in sequence, I named all the files to correspond with their chapter sections: <code>1_0_0intro.mp3</code>, <code>1_1_0before.mp3</code>, and <code>1_3_1textAgent.mp3</code>, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, I recommend starting this chapter by first scanning all the lists that appear in point form and also reading and/or listening to the <a href="why.html#key-points">Key Points</a>. Doing so should provide you with a gist of the chapter before you dig into the particulars. As you proceed through the chapter, you can consult the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> when the terms I am using are new or unclear and the footnotes when you want to follow the book’s breadcrumbs and learn more about related materials, including the scholarship and fiction that inform the observations I am rehearsing. When you finish the chapter, you may want to read all the footnotes and identify which breadcrumbs especially interest you.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no need to worry about the intricacies of text editors (such as Sublime and Atom) if you are new to them. I address those details in Chapter 3, <a href="blog.html">“Making a Simple Blog.”</a> You can rely on the instructions in <a href="why.html#prompts-1a">“Prompts 1A”</a> for now.</p>

<p>If media are indeed everywhere, then they are difficult to define. Here I humbly submit one possible definition, intended primarily for the purposes of this book but supported by scholarship and, I hope, applicable to other contexts.</p>
<p>Media are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Material agents</em> for turning this into that,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>labour and techniques</em> involved in working with those agents,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>social practices</em> made durable through those agents,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>experiences</em> of engaging with those agents, and <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>cultures and values</em> entwined with those agents.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that I am not addressing <em>the</em> media, journalism, or mass communication in this definition. These areas are beyond the scope of this textbook, even if they may, and do, frequently overlap with studies of contemporary media and fiction.</p>
<p>Media are often conflated with technologies as well.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I wish to avoid such conflation in this book if only for the sake of consistency and clarity in delineation.</p>
<p>Technologies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are social, cultural, and material <em>systems for reproducing media</em>, and</li>
<li>Include, for instance, print for text, photography for images, phonography for audio, and computing for all three.</li>
</ol>
<p>This definition acknowledges the relationship between media and technologies without assuming they are synonymous. It also proves useful for understanding how media are interpreted within the field of media studies.</p>
<p>I admit that both of these definitions are rather abstract, so I will elaborate on them in this section with text as my example. You may notice that, in treating text as a medium, I am not speaking broadly of “the text” as you may typically do in English class: as a methodological field where any object or event, from a book to a film to a building to a wrestling match, is “the text” subject to interpretation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I begin instead with the more narrow premise that media, including text, are material agents.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>When people hear the word, “text,” they may think of sequences or strings of characters used to transform what is thought or spoken into words presented on a page or screen.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This book is composed mostly of text, and this paragraph is a block of characters, which include letters as well as punctuation marks, numbers, and . . . spaces. Indeed, my operating system produces what’s called an ASCII or Unicode character whenever I press the spacebar on my computer’s keyboard.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Figure 1.1 offers an example, where I converted the string, “Contemporary Media and Fiction,” into decimals. <code>032</code> is the ASCII decimal value for <code></code> (a space), <code>77</code> for <code>M</code>, <code>109</code> for <code>m</code>, and so on.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<hr />
<div class="figure">
<img src="media/1_1ascii.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIGURE 1.1: “Contemporary Media and Fiction” converted into ASCII decimal values. <code>032</code> is a space in the string of characters.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>These decimal values are stored in bytes on a disk or computer drive. If I print them, they are stored in ink on paper. That’s a rather banal observation with some significant consequences.</p>
<p>Text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is an agent for transformation (“turning this into that”),</li>
<li>May be intended for multiple destinations, including page and screen; and</li>
<li>May be stored across a variety of locations, from a local drive to the cloud to ink on paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes storage and display are collocated, if not collapsed. When I open a print novel, for instance, I trust the words will be there, even if the pages are torn or I spilled coffee on them (see Figure 1.2). Yet I may not presume as much with electricity and computers, where storage and display are separate mechanisms.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The server for this book may not respond, or my laptop battery may be dead. A computer may also intervene in my writing. Software may crash, or, as I type, my word processor may format text against my intentions.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> People notice media the most during moments like these. Connections are down. Work is lost. Rhythm and flow are interrupted.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> My phone has once again auto-corrected my name to “Dysentery.”</p>

<hr />
<p>While these technical details may not be thrilling, they highlight how text is a means with some substance, like film for photography or marble for sculpture. This attention to substance may help us to better grasp text’s various functions as a material agent.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Text as a material agent is a messenger or carrier. This is most obvious when text becomes a verb: I text friends messages and assume they are in receipt. I trust the agent until I encounter hiccups or glitches. Whether the messages are actually read, or understood as intended, is an entirely different matter.</li>
<li>Text as a material agent is subject to time and weather. Draft chapters printed on stacks of paper are fading on the sun-exposed shelves of my office, and the files for this book will gradually degrade. Print or electronic, text inevitably rots and decays.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It’s an agent with—not a form or tool outside—history, precisely because it is a means with some substance.<br />
</li>
<li>Text as a material agent is “remediated.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Consider finding a Courier typeface from 1955 in your word processor, a searchable edition of Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> from 1888 on the Internet Archive, or a QWERTY typewriter layout from 1878 on your keyboard (see Figure 1.3).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Media age, but they morph and mutate, too, as computers evidently absorb all the things to reduce the friction of past designs—to render history user-friendly in the present. I can type much faster on my laptop from 2018 than with a typewriter from 1955; nevertheless; computers contain more parts and features, which must be maintained and updated regularly. I encounter more and more media on my laptop as the past appears immediate through it.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>

</div>
<hr />
<p>These three observations bring me to the first key point of this chapter: <em>people instill their trust in media and use them as means for transforming this into that; however, since media are material agents, they cannot be completely controlled.</em> They rot, decay, morph, and mutate, and they may interrupt rhythm and flow through disconnections, glitches, bugs, and automated interventions. To repurpose William Morris’s remark, which has been paraphrased by hundreds of scholars, including scholars of text: “You can’t have media without resistance in the material.”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Morris apparently said “art,” not “media,” but, again, I am beginning this inquiry with a more narrow focus on the stuff of agents.</p>

<p>People notice media when things go awry—when connections are down, work is lost, and rhythm and flow are interrupted—but also during the oft-dreaded learning curve. Writers, designers, editors, publishers, and indeed readers dedicate plenty of labour, not to mention time and resources, to learning approaches to text: everything from typing, typography, word processing, indexing, and copy editing to creative writing, close reading, annotation, translation, and web design. Text is labour here because it is a process,<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> not just a thing, and that process is embodied. It requires physical as well as emotional and mental activity. After all, words do not magically appear on screens and pages, one reason why I am often reluctant to write or edit. It can be a struggle: tiring, if not exhausting, especially when I have fallen out of practice or I doubt myself as I go. Many other factors contribute to the labour as well. People may have learning disabilities or visual impairments, they may be multitasking or writing across two or more languages, and perhaps they need to meet a deadline. The list goes on, yet each of these factors stresses how media are not merely means. People do more than <em>use</em> media as material agents; they design, compose, revise, and circulate work <em>with</em> and <em>through</em> them, too.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></p>
<p>This very notion of media beyond use—beyond tool or instrument, if you will—brings me to the second key point of this chapter: <em>If media are techniques for working with material agents, then they are techniques with a situation and purpose, if not a strategy. The context and appeals of media matter.</em><a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Text from this perspective is a craft, and it may be approached from numerous angles.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> In fact, the abundance of angles, or the sheer number of options and possibilities, results in classification, where (pardon the pun) text is wrangled or categorized into types: “descriptive,” “expository,” “persuasive,” and “instructive” text, as well as “code,” for example.<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> While these labels may be useful for starting a project or identifying components of a work and dissecting it into chunks, a more pertinent question is how, under what assumptions, and for which situations media are crafted. What does text want me to do here? What does it assume or even expect I will do?</p>
<p>One way to engage how text is crafted is to examine the ways it recedes from attention to reduce friction. Well-designed or well-written text is frequently said to disappear from view: to help people forget they are reading.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> This way, they can focus on an author’s style or “voice” instead of the stuff on the page. Novelists, for example, likely want their readers to concentrate on characterization, dialogue, narrative, irony, and allusion, not layouts or typefaces like Papyrus (see Figure 1.4).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<hr />
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">FIGURE 1.4: “What does that mean?” printed in Papyrus; then in Century Schoolbook, which is popular in children’s books and pulp novels; and then in Garamond, which is popular across a range of genres and formats.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>They may also want their audiences to know where the edges are, hence the prevalence of margins and pages produced by the grid system of most books.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Once you identify the edge, you can focus on the centre, also called “body text” and “running text.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the design of games, some genres, such as simulators (or “sims”), may push text mostly, if not entirely, to the background, where it operates in the menu system or functions as code.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> The absence of text on a screen tends to reduce people’s feeling that play is being mediated by an interface. It ostensibly increases flow or immersion, as text and menu options recede from view. Yet immersion is highly subjective, as it is contingent upon individual preferences and embodied experiences. While one person may enjoy a driving simulator, for instance, another may resist it because it feels manipulative or produces motion sickness. Such differences make media interesting; they move beyond labels into strategies and techniques. Asking whether a given game is immersive is less suggestive than asking how and when it wants specific media to recede from attention.</p>
<p>Of course, a work may <em>not</em> want media to recede from view. Text is routinely crafted to address its audience quite directly.<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a> It may:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Instruct you: “Please use other door.” “Stop.” “Click here.” It does not, in this instance, disappear; it tells you what to do, perhaps politely.</li>
<li>Instruct a computer: <code>&lt;a href="https://jntry.work/cmf/why.html"&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt;</code> and <code>print("Hello World")</code>. Even if it is not immediately visible, it can tell computers what to do through markup or code.</li>
<li>Get meta: “Let’s start with the end of the world, why don’t we? Get it over with and move on to more interesting things,” begins N.K. Jemisin’s <em>The Fifth Season</em> (2015). In cases such as this one, text may comment on its status as artifice.<br />

<p>Again, the more compelling question here is not whether a given work is direct or didactic but what and whom it wants particular media to address, and how and when it addresses them. Can we ever know for sure what was actually intended by a particular decision or technique in a given work? No. The labour of media dissolves into the very works that aim to preserve it.<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> That is, media absorb labour. Even though their quality—their fidelity, resolution, and definition—improve over time with the development of technologies, they are never perfect records of what happened and why.<a href="#fn31" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> No matter how clear or crisp the production, you can never extract or recover all the labour that went into something. You can, however, consider which strategies a work appears to be employing: how and under what assumptions it addresses or immerses you.</p>
<p>This brings me to the third key point of this chapter: <em>No media seize or capture the totality of a process and its motivations. We may nevertheless attend to how media are crafted to be noticed or ignored.</em></p>

<p>While media cannot seize or capture the totality of a process—how and why, exactly, this became that—they can enter circulation. I used the English language and text from the modern English alphabet to write and read this book, which I then shared as a bundle of files online. More people may read it now that it is published, and I might even get some feedback. People may also quote it (in or out of context) or amplify or interpret it in ways I neither intended nor anticipated. Perhaps I will return to it years later and wonder what I actually meant by this sentence or that one.</p>
<p>The primary observation for now is also the fourth key point of this chapter: <em>Media connect people while also alienating them from each other and their work.</em> That’s the antinomy of media’s durability—of putting technique and practice into circulation.
Text becomes both communication and miscommunication, process and product. And throughout it all, from ideation and early drafts to publication and feedback, text is social, <em>and</em> it renders durable the social process.</p>
<p>This statement may appear more obvious with the production of games or films, which are usually produced collaboratively, but it pertains to text, too. This book began in the middle. I drew on the past while writing for a future audience, and I got suggestions (thank you, Faith, Stefan, and Brooken!) as I wrote. Now it is online. Will the messages be received? Will they arrive <em>and</em> be understood? I will never know for sure, and that’s the trick with media and communication. People routinely meet each other halfway, in the middle, somewhere between intent and interpretation.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration, then, to say I am disciplined by text. Ok, that does sound pretty severe. I simply mean that media enable repetition and habituation. As people read and write with text, they do so, again, with a situation and purpose: deciding to read fiction rather than the news, or writing flavour text instead of an argument, for instance. Since the practices of reading and writing vary, often dramatically, from situation to situation, and from group to group, text affords some consistency and stability, if you will. It normalizes embodied practice, as witnessed in the standardization of manuscript through movable type, from writing by hand and gesture to writing with machines and manufactured characters. Recall the QWERTY layout I mentioned earlier, now remediated for millions of keyboards (see Figure 1.6).</p>
<hr />
<div class="figure">

</div>
<hr />
<p>People learn these standards in school and at work, where they are memorized and shared. I no longer need to look at my keyboard while typing; it’s automatic, part of my motor memory. It, more or less by default, shapes how I sense and make sense of the world and how I interact with people and machines.</p>
<p>Such processes of memory and habituation are further standardized through formats. Here are two among many examples relevant to the study of text:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Publication formats are means of nesting and presenting text in familiar ways. They include books, articles, magazines, and websites as well as novels, short stories, and comics, for example. (I encourage you to follow a publication format, namely a blog with certain conventions, in Chapter 3.)</li>
<li>File formats, on the other hand, are means of storing and circulating text for computer work. They include TXT, DOC, RTF, and CSV, for instance. (The file formats at play in Chapter 3 include HTML and CSS.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Although file formats are standards in the more literal sense of the word, all formats are social. They result from decisions made by people yet frequently delegated to machines for processing and storage. They may be proprietary, open, or somewhere in between, and, again, they are intended for circulation. What makes them so powerful is that they are boring by design—so banal they are easily woven into the fabric of everyday interaction, hence the fifth key point of this chapter: <em>Media are vehicles for memory and habituation. They are formatted and standardized to encourage consistency across groups and situations.</em></p>

<p>Despite the prevalence of standardized media, people can of course experiment with text, too. I may write in the margins, play with a format, make up a word, or create an alphabet for a fantasy world. Or my engagement may not unfold in writing. Recalling my previous remarks about immersion in “Text as a Technique,” I may avoid particular experiences or formats even if they are the norm. Perhaps I am not the intended audience, or I am skeptical of how I am (or am not) being addressed, or I consider a given work to be problematic despite its popularity or canonical status.</p>
<p><em>The effects of media are not homogeneous. Media do not determine how they are used or experienced even if they discipline activity and facilitate habituation.</em> This is the sixth key point of this chapter, and it underscores the limitations of so-called “determinist” and “instrumentalist” paradigms for media studies. Media do not fall from the sky and suddenly impact society and culture. As I mentioned in “Text as a Material Agent” and “Text as a Social Practice,” they are remediated, and they have histories and contexts. Even if people use media to turn this into that, media are not mere instruments, partly because their effects are not predetermined but also since they are more like agents than tools. They cannot be completely controlled, and they are the materials of both habit and art.</p>
<p>Critics of media move along this spectrum of discipline and experimentation, attending primarily to habits and norms at one end, and play and creativity at the other. Both are vital to approaching media. They intersect and overlap, and they frequently result in some fascinating contradictions. I can, for instance, recall the styles of my favourite writers and the pleasure of reading books I love. Sometimes I enjoy a novel so much I think it transcends time. I not only forget I am reading it; I also believe it will never feel “dated” or generic. An author’s compelling, if not singular, experiment with text keeps me caring about fiction and lures me back, over and over again, to reading and writing. Others, of course, may not share my investments, and they may have their doubts. This is a theme in Allison Bechdel’s <em>Fun Home</em> (discussed further in Chapter 5). While various men in her life are apparently devoted to James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>, Bechdel has little patience for it and the culture associated with it (see Figure 1.7).</p>
<hr />
<div class="figure">

</div>
<hr />
<p>That’s what’s so interesting about the aesthetics of text, and it is also the seventh key point of this chapter: <em>media foster an embodied, personal experience and may then capitalize on that experience.</em> Text, for example, manages to convert my joy of reading and writing into an activity productive of value. I buy more and more books. I circulate more and more media. Maybe I share my highlights with Amazon, track my habits with Goodreads, or routinely wonder whether I read the “right” books as an English major. What <em>was</em> the most productive, or most valuable, use of my reading time?</p>
<p>So the aesthetics of text are political, too. Values inform which media I like and how I experience them, not to mention how I read and write with text. Values also inform what enters a canon of great works and what elevates some media over others. Consider, for example, debates about showing versus telling in formats like comics and novels. Who deems text to be more compelling, or more literary, than an image? When, why, and under what assumptions? Questions such as these underscore how media intersect with definitions of taste and determinations of value, yet also remind people why the time and resources required to study <em>and</em> enjoy media—to play and imagine without always being productive—is necessary for everyone, not just an elite few.</p>

<p>As is likely clear at this point in the chapter, media are entwined with culture and values. They are not neutral forms but rather agents, practices, and experiences baked with assumptions and bias. To approach this aspect of text, I will draw from the cultural materialism of Raymond Williams (1977), who outlines the “residual,” “dominant,” and “emergent” elements of culture (121-27).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Text as a residual element of culture: This is text as a congealed relation or past institution that is still active in the present (122-23). Remediation once again comes to mind, alongside the persistence of habits, formats, and standards like QWERTY. Another key cultural dimension of text is its historical role in colonization. Colonizers from Europe, for instance, used the alphabetic letter to construct the very notion of “literate” and “illiterate” subjects, including colonial and Indigenous subjects, and the imposition of alphabetic instruction was central to colonial discipline and education. Today, a bulk of primary, secondary, and post-secondary learning remains invested in text. In fact, text is arguably <em>the</em> primary medium of public education in English across Canada and the U.S. It is an ever-present residue of colonial projects. Yet people may also craft text to resist, subvert, or reject colonialism. Examples from this textbook include N.K. Jemisin’s <em>The Fifth Season</em>, Nalo Hopkinson’s “Message in a Bottle,” and <em>Biidaaban (The Dawn Comes)</em> by Amanda Strong and Leanne Betasamosake Simpson.</p></li>
<li><p>Text as a dominant element of culture: This is text as a norm that subsumes the past while also presenting itself as . . . the present. QWERTY is an 1878 typewriter layout, and yet it is very much a 2020 layout, too. I am writing with it right now. From the perspective of the dominant element, I may also account for the labour of text, such as the particular working conditions of writing, editing, and design as well as which occupations are valued most and who gets credit for their contributions to a given project. One example is #ThanksForTyping, a hashtag dedicated to women who—without compensation and often without attribution—typed, edited, translated, and even researched and wrote books for men, who often were also their husbands (see Figure 1.8). Other approaches to text as a dominant element of culture include attending to who and which values dominate popular communication networks, publication venues, editorial boards, and standards in addition to who is addressed and represented by them. Consider, for instance, how cis white males are the majority in most Anglophone (or Western) literary canons. Dominant culture is most entrenched when it becomes “common sense”: when it may be taken for granted as obvious, as a given without question, let alone objection. Here, “sense” in media studies implies what is known and what is perceived (“sensus communis”), and text frequently becomes the common ground for such sense-making.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>Text as an emergent element: This is text as a novel technique, practice, perception, or value, if not a new occupation or class (123-26). Perhaps it opposes dominant culture or offers an alternative to common sense applications of text. Either way, emergence cannot be attributed solely to the makeup or material of media as <em>means</em>. The use of text in video games and ebooks, for instance, was not an emergent element simply because it relied on new digital technologies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. After all, video games and ebooks may, and do, borrow heavily from formats, like tabletop games and print books, that preceded them. The politics and aesthetics of each may also be quite conventional. The question, then, is how material agents, techniques, social practices, experiences, and culture come together to produce something unanticipated by and irreducible to dominant culture. Examples from this textbook include work by Marina Kittaka and Alison Bechdel as well as Jemisin, Hopkinson, Strong, and Simpson, whom I mentioned earlier. The basic premise of emergent elements, though, is that a dominant culture will never manage to engage, let alone represent, every possible practice and intention (125). It is selective, and it aims to produce value for those who benefit from it. It may thus absorb aspects of residual and emergent elements over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These points together demonstrate the eighth key point of this chapter as well as the ninth: <em>Media are not</em> the <em>message, even if they contribute to and proliferate meaning-making</em>; and, <em>media are not only known and evident but felt, anticipated, and conjectured—what are treated as common sense as well as what are residual and emerging.</em> This ninth point in particular highlights why both records and fiction matter for media studies.</p>

<p>If we follow the five-part definition of media above, then abbreviated definitions of audio, image, text, and action may unfold like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audio is a material agent for transforming <em>sound</em>, plus the labour, techniques, social practices, experiences, cultures, and values associated with that agent. Some practices commonly associated with audio are hearing, listening, and speaking.<br />
</li>
<li>Images are material agents for transforming <em>light and graphics</em>, plus the labour, techniques, social practices, experiences, cultures, and values associated with those agents. Some practices commonly associated with images are seeing, looking, and watching.</li>
<li>Text is a material agent for transforming <em>alphanumeric characters</em> (including punctuation marks and spaces), plus the labour, techniques, social practices, experiences, cultures, and values associated with that agent. Some practices commonly associated with text are looking, reading, and writing.<br />
</li>
<li>Finally, action is a material agent for transforming <em>process</em>, plus the labour, techniques, social practices, experiences, cultures, and values associated with that agent. Some practices commonly associated with action are programming, searching, navigating, and playing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that I use “transforming” rather than “recording,” mostly because I wish to underscore how misleading the notions of “capture” and “extraction” can be. Examples of transformation include producing audio in a studio and taking a simple photograph. Both involve decisions with situations and purposes. Voice actors perform in ways mostly unique to studios, and their voices are processed for listeners. Meanwhile, photographs may be staged or candid; either way, they frame a moment and project a particular perspective.</p>
<p>In each case, media are not capturing phenomena in the world or extracting data from it. They are playing active roles in the workflows of design, composition, documentation, and communication; and, curiously enough, aspects of those workflows may remain inaccessible during people’s engagements with media. Even experts in media production may not know how, exactly, this becomes that when they are using technologies, and—since so much of the process is now automated and computational—we almost never see, listen, or somehow witness it firsthand. Some of the transformation might as well be magic, if you will, hence the amount of trust people instill in media.</p>
<p>This brings me to the tenth key point of this chapter: <em>The language of “transformation” as opposed to “recording” stresses how media are materials and techniques entangled with culture and social practices, which they render durable rather than capture.</em> Media are things, like typefaces and file formats, and the processes, such as reading and writing, that persist with and through those things. Or, media correspond and converse with the past more than they precisely or objectively represent it. Records are made and so, too, are fictions.</p>
<p>You may notice, by the way, that I did not include video or motion pictures in my list of primary media. Although video is a topic and material appearing regularly in the book, I engage it through the combination of audio, image, and text and not as a medium unto itself. I also draw mostly from my own training in media and literary studies and, by extension, avoid venturing much into film, cinema, television, or theatre studies. These are all limitations of this textbook. Video is of course a medium, and media and fiction can and certainly do learn from film, cinema, television, and theatre studies.</p>
<p>There is also game studies, which especially informs my selection of action as a medium, including its treatment in Chapter 7, “Action and Fiction.” When compared with audio, image, and text, I assume action may be less familiar to you as a medium. Allow me, then, to elaborate for a moment. Games epitomize action’s status as media, where you find plenty of buttons, links, and menus. Action from this perspective may be understood as media for navigating other media. Action is the stuff of interfaces, and interfaces are the space of action: rewind the audio file or increase its playback speed, turn a page, search for text and copy it, crop or filter an image, choose your own adventure, press A to talk to NPCs. Action in these cases renders a process durable by delegating it to buttons and other interface elements.</p>
<p>Yet action also occurs within a field of other options and, in that case, is usually articulated in terms of structure or procedure, where it is less about the buttons you press than a “map” of possibilities that may affect you. Perhaps you cannot see or hear what is coming next, or your decision triggers an unanticipated chain of events in a story (see Figures 1.9 and 1.10). Video games are an obvious example here, but also consider “nonlinear” stories, procedurally generated fiction, and “interactive” video, for instance. They demonstrate how action is in the middle, between people and machines (or players and code), reducible to neither individual choices nor rules and procedures. Action is the medium of interfaces and possibility spaces.</p>

<hr />
<p>While there are many frameworks for approaching media (see the footnote to this sentence for a list of them), one potential benefit of attending specifically to audio, image, text, and action is the range and flexibility of interpretation afforded by the lack of adjectives typically used to delimit or qualify them: “electronic” or “print” text as well as “digital” or “analog” image, for instance. The reality is that people work across these dichotomies. Drafts and prototypes may be developed without digital computers, and histories of analog and print media are baked into today’s techniques and technologies. Equally important, people’s interpretations and embodied experiences of media are usually quite analog (or continuous), not digital (or discrete). There’s the issue of formats as well. A single novel may appear in print, EPUB, and HTML, or you may play video and tabletop versions of the same game. In fact, franchises like <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>, for example, thrive on trans-media, cross-format strategies, and people hardly ever stick to a single medium or format for their fictions. For all these reasons and more, the following chapters avoid adjectives for audio, image, text, and action where possible.</p>

<p>Defining fiction is, like defining media, no small task. Here, nevertheless, is the definition I humbly submit for the purposes of this book.</p>
<p>Fiction is:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>When audio, image, and/or text are used to imagine a story, character, setting, conflict, and/or event.</li>
<li>Not restricted to prose or novels.</li>
<li>Not exactly a work—as in a “work of fiction”—but rather a component or aspect of a work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I wrote this textbook with undergraduate Humanities courses, especially English courses, in mind, I will conjecture that you are somewhat familiar with studies of fiction at this point in your education. Fiction in primary and secondary education is often taught in the context of novels and prose. As you can see, I am expanding that approach, and—as the title of this textbook suggests—I want to articulate fiction with the study of media, where you may encounter a few common tensions.</p>
<p><em>Between fiction and deceit:</em> Even though fiction is speculative or imaginative, I do not need to assume it is deceitful. Even if it is not my lived reality, or someone else’s lived reality, people may consider it to be quite true, or at least compelling. And it may very well correspond with actual events and records. Bechdel’s <em>Fun Home</em> (see Chapter 5) is an excellent example here.</p>
<p><em>Between story and narrative</em>: People tend to assume fiction has a story and narrative, yet the two terms are frequently conflated, and it may at times be useful (and not just academic) to distinguish between them. Stories are components of fiction’s content: its plot, character(s), conflict(s), setting(s), and point(s) of view. Narrative is more meta: fiction’s use of flashbacks, narrator(s), world building, character development, and closure, for instance. Perhaps a story is what’s told, and a narrative is how, and under what assumptions, it is told. Another common tendency in popular discourse is to treat narrative like a tendency or trope: a way of communicating or storytelling that’s become familiar, if not cliché. YHCHI’s <em>M00D 0F THE M0MENT</em> is interesting for its approach to story and narrative. How the story is told seems to eclipse what is being told, partly because of YHCHI’s unique combination of audio, image, text, and action.</p>
<p><em>Between genre, style, and literature</em>: I have already mentioned some of fiction’s formats: games, novels, comics, podcasts, and short fiction, among others. A format is not synonymous with genre, which is a constellation of recognizable conventions accompanied by audience expectations: the genres of fantasy, romance, mystery, simulation, adventure, and science fiction, for example. Both genres and formats expand and change over time, often in conversation with the style, or “signature,” associated with a particular artist, author, or group. What, for instance, distinguishes N.K. Jemisin’s science fiction and fantasy from that of her predecessors, such as Ursula K. Le Guin or Samuel R. Delany? When does style brush against genre conventions and expectations? And finally, what is the relationship between literature and genre? Historically, literature has been positioned against genre. It is precisely what is <em>not</em> generic or conventional, or it elevates the “how” (narrative, style) of fiction over the “what” (plot, content). More recently, it has been treated as a genre itself: “literary fiction,” where people may expect allusion, social commentary, and, perhaps most relevant to this textbook, artistry with respect to text as a medium. While this textbook does not dedicate much time to isolating what is literary about fiction, past tensions between genre and literature, or genre and style, are worth recalling. Also important is the tradition of entangling the literary with text and prose. People may raise their brows if you speak of literary video games or literary images, for example. Why is that?</p>
<p><em>Between communities</em>: Media studies prompts attention to the various communities involved in fiction’s production. Familiar communities include authors, readers, critics, and publishers. Although the economies and platforms that bring these communities together often assign them discrete roles, the boundaries between them and their practices are not so clear. When, for instance, do readers become fans, and when do fans become authors? Or, what conditions and values enable palpable divides between “creatives” and critics, developers and consumers? Finally, how do these various communities shape people’s perceptions of where a given work begins and ends? An amusing example is TheoUnderStars, an Instagram account by Theo, who is a character in <em>Celeste</em> (see Figure 1.11). Theo is a hiker and photographer who climbs Celeste mountain, and the game’s developer, Extremely Ok Games, created the account to develop his story through images and text. What’s more, they started the account in 2017, prior to the game’s release in 2018. The account, like many other approaches to media, highlights why drawing neat lines between contributions or around particular works of fiction is less compelling than following the feedback loops between communities and components. Feedback loops keep things social.</p>

</div>
<hr />
<p>These four tensions bring me to the eleventh key point of this chapter: <em>Fiction is a space where media ask “what if?” while engaging history, narrative conventions, genre expectations, and community practices.</em> Imagination unfolds within these contexts and may conform to some while resisting or rejecting others.</p>

<p>So why study contemporary media and fiction? My pithy response to this question is that all experiences of fiction are mediated. Learning more about mediation thus enriches people’s understanding and perception of fiction as a thing and process. Contemporary media also commingle and converge in fiction, and a significant portion of them are not only designed and developed collaboratively but also engaged socially. Studying media and fiction together builds knowledge of such convergence—of how media and fiction are made, practiced, and experienced as well as how they are entwined with society, culture, and values.</p>
<p>“Ok,” you might wonder, “what is the <em>point</em> of studying contemporary media and fiction in the 2020s?” Consider the following list, which responds to this question of relevance, if not usefulness, via the paradigm of communication. This paradigm is motivated not by cultural capital—“Which books have you read?”—or technical skills—“Which tasks can you perform?”–but rather by the aesthetics and politics of relation through imagination—“What and how could we communicate?”</p>
<p>Approaching media and fiction together attends to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Situation</strong>, or the <em>context of communication</em>, including how, when, and where people relate and collaborate through particulars works of media and fiction.</li>
<li><strong>Composition</strong>, or the <em>content of communication</em>, including what people read, see, hear, watch, and play in particular works of media and fiction and how those works are made.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Audience</strong>, or the <em>address and purpose of communication</em>, including what people need, want, and/or expect from particular works of media and fiction as well as who is represented by them.</li>
<li><strong>Norms</strong>, or the <em>values of communication</em>, including why and under what assumptions people deem a particular work of media and fiction to be credible, compelling, biased, predictable, or problematic.</li>
<li><strong>Novelty</strong>, or the <em>uniqueness of communication</em>, including how and why particular works of media and fiction are considered to be innovative, experimental, literary, derivative, or generic.</li>
<li><strong>Engagement</strong>, or the <em>experience of communication</em>, including what people feel and remember about particular works of media and fiction.</li>
<li><strong>Design</strong>, or the <em>interface of communication</em>, including what people notice and ignore and how they navigate the content and context of media and fiction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The acronym SCANNED may facilitate recollection here, and it leads to the twelfth key point of this chapter: <em>Studying media and fiction together attends to the situation, composition, audience, norms, novelty, engagement, and design (SCANNED) of communication.</em> None of these is restricted to the academy or academic research, and I hope they prove to be useful in your own work.</p>

<p>Here is a list of key points made in this chapter. This list is merely a duplication of the points that appear above. I hope it sustains, rather than resolves, the contradictions resulting from the observations I rehearsed. Contradictions are integral components of the interpretative process, which is neither neat nor tidy.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>People instill their trust in media and use them as means for transforming this into that; however, since media are material agents, they cannot be completely controlled.</li>
<li>If media are techniques for working with material agents, then they are techniques with a situation and purpose, if not a strategy. The context and appeals of media matter.</li>
<li>No media seize or capture the totality of a process and its motivations. We may nevertheless attend to how media are crafted to be noticed or ignored.</li>
<li>Media connect people while also alienating them from each other and their work.</li>
<li>Media are vehicles for memory and habituation. They are formatted and standardized to encourage consistency of use across groups and situations.</li>
<li>The effects of media are not homogeneous. Media do not determine how they are used or experienced even if they discipline activity and facilitate habituation.</li>
<li>Media foster an embodied, personal experience and may then capitalize on that experience.</li>
<li>Media are not <em>the</em> message, even if they contribute to and proliferate meaning-making.</li>
<li>Media are not only known and evident but felt, anticipated, and conjectured—what are treated as common sense as well as what are residual and emerging.</li>
<li>The language of “transformation” as opposed to “recording” stresses how media are materials and techniques entangled with culture and social practices, which they render durable rather than capture.</li>
<li>Fiction is a space where media ask “what if?” while engaging history, narrative conventions, genre expectations, and community practices.</li>
<li>Studying media and fiction together attends to the situation, composition, audience, norms, novelty, engagement, and design (SCANNED) of communication.</li>

<ol start="1">
<li id="fn1"><p>Here, I am indebted to Matthew Fuller’s <em>Media Ecologies</em> (2005), especially Chapter 3, “How This Becomes That,” as well as Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s <em>Remediation</em> (1999) and N. Katherine Hayles’s <em>Writing Machines</em> (2002), designed by Anne Burdick. Bolter and Grusin reiterate the material dimensions of media by attending to acts of borrowing and adaptation: “When artists or technicians create the apparatus for a new medium, they do so with reference to previous media, borrowing and adapting materials and techniques whenever possible” (68). Meanwhile, Hayles argues for the centrality of materiality to literary studies: “Materiality of the artifact can no longer be positioned as a subspecialty within literary studies; it must be central, for without it we have little hope of forging a robust and nuanced account of how literature is changing under the impact of information technologies” (19). Hayles’s method is “media-specific analysis” (MSA): “In calling for MSA, I do not mean to advocate that media should be considered in isolation from one another. On the contrary, media constantly engage in a recursive dynamic of imitating each other, incorporating aspects of competing media into themselves while simultaneously flaunting the advantages their own forms of mediation offer” (30).<a href="why.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Questions of labour are frequently associated with the everydayness of media. See, for instance, Lisa Nakamura (2014): “the everydayness of digital media will require us to pay more attention to the media platforms and communities, digital and otherwise, where so many of us live our lives.” Also see Vicki Mayer on labour (2017).<a href="why.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Raymond Williams’s “From Medium to Social Practice” in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977) is key to understanding media’s relation to language and social practices as are the work of Lisa Gitelman (2006) and Susan Leigh Star (1989 with Griesemer; 2000 with Bowker). Gitelman: “I define media as socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mental map, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation” (7).<a href="why.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Wendy Hui Kyong Chun demonstrates the centrality of media to the experience of memory in particular, referring to digital media as the “enduring ephemeral” (95). The notion of experience is also frequently associated with aesthetics, where Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) proves to be important. See Benjamin’s collection of essays, <em>Illuminations</em>, edited by Hannah Arendt.<a href="why.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Key historical works here include <em>Culture, Media, Language: Working Papers in Cultural Studies, 1972-79</em> (1980; 2005), edited by Stuart Hall <em>et al.</em>, and John Berger’s <em>Ways of Seeing</em> (1972). More recent publications include <em>Media/Cultural Studies: Critical Approaches</em> (2009), edited by Rhonda Hammer and Douglas Kellner, and Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum’s <em>Values at Play in Digital Games</em> (2014).<a href="why.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>For instance, as Paul Jones (1998) notes in his analysis of debates between Marshall McLuhan and Raymond Williams, McLuhan “systematically conflates” media and technology in <em>Understanding Media</em> (1964), especially in Chapter 1, “The Medium Is the Message.” The two terms were often interchangeable for McLuhan.<a href="why.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Roland Barthes is especially well known for approaching text as a methodological field. See “From Work to Text” in <em>Image-Music-Text</em> (1977) and <em>Mythologies</em> (1957, 1972), including “The World of Wrestling.” Many aspects of Barthes’s scholarship are associated with “media semiotics,” which attends to the roles media play in symbols and signification.<a href="why.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Responding to Barthes, Hayles writes the following in <em>Writing Machines</em> (2002): “In positioning text against work, Barthes was among those who initiated semiotic and performative approaches to discourse, arguably one of the most important developments in literary studies in the last century. But this shift has entailed loss as well as gain. Useful as the vocabulary of text was in expanding textuality beyond the printed page, it also had the effect, in treating everything from fashion to fascism as a semiotic system, of eliding differences in materiality. Perhaps now, after the linguistic turn has yielded so many important insights, it is time to turn again to a careful consideration of what difference the materiality of the medium makes” (30).<a href="why.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>In <em>Thinking with Type</em>, Ellen Lupton defines text via typography: “In typography, ‘text’ is defined as an ongoing sequence of words, distinct from shorter headlines and or caption. The main block is often called ‘the body,’ comprising the principal mass of content. Also known as ‘running text,’ it can flow from one page, column, or box to another. Text can be viewed as a thing—a sound and sturdy object—or a fluid poured into the containers of page or screen” (87).<a href="why.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>ASCII stands for “American Standard Code for Information Interchange.”<a href="why.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This entire process is technically more complex than my explanation here. For more details, see <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/computer-systems/0/steps/53503">“Pressing a Key”</a> by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, published by FutureLearn.<a href="why.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Hayles writes the following in <em>My Mother Was a Computer</em> (2005): “With electronic texts, the data files may be on one server and the machine creating the display may be in another location entirely, which means that electronic text exists as a distributed phenomenon” (101). For more on the importance of storage and inscription to media studies, see Matthew Kirschenbaum’s <em>Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</em>, including his distinction between “formal” and “forensic” materiality (2008).<a href="why.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>If you are interested in a history of word processing, then see Kirschenbaum’s <em>Track Changes</em> (2017).<a href="why.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research, including <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> (1990), is often mentioned in this context. Also relevant is Henri Lefebvre’s <em>Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time, and Everyday Life</em> (1992; 2004).<a href="why.html#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>For a fascinating case study here, see Porter Olsen’s “Emulation as Mimicry: Reading the Salman Rushdie Digital Archive” (2019), which engages the technical and colonial dimensions of emulation, a technique often used to preserve text and writing environments.<a href="why.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Bolter and Grusin’s <em>Remediation</em> (1999) is important here, particularly what they call the “double logic of remediation”: “Our culture wants to both multiply its media and to erase all traces of mediation” (5). Remediation thus involves a consideration of both hypermediacy and immediacy.<a href="why.html#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>You can read an 1888 edition of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus</em> at the <a href="https://archive.org/details/frankensteinorm02shelgoog/page/n6/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.<a href="why.html#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Again, this is what Bolter and Grusin (1999) call the “double logic of remediation.” Also see Chun’s notion of the “enduring ephemeral” in <em>Programmed Visions</em> (2011).<a href="why.html#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>For an account of Morris’s remark, see Bethany Nowviskie’s “Resistance in the Materials” (2013): “It’s a compelling line—reproduced (somewhat mechanically and often slightly mangled) all over, and only rarely contextualized or traced back to its source. Morris’s erstwhile son-in-law, Henry Halliday Sparling, reports it in a 1924 study of the Kelmscott Press, as part of the designer’s extended complaint about a newfangled device: the typewriter.”<a href="why.html#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn20"><p>Arendt’s <em>The Human Condition</em> (1958, 1998) is often referenced by scholars of labour. For Arendt, labour is a human necessity, not something that can be transcended. For more recent work on the relations between labour and media, see <em>Digital Labor: The Internet as Playground and Factory</em> (2013), edited by Trebor Scholz. This book is especially useful for understanding how play becomes labour in the 21st century.<a href="why.html#fnref20" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn21"><p>See Tara McPherson’s work in <em>Cinema Journal</em> (2009) for more about the important distinctions between writing <em>about</em> and participating <em>through</em> media in media studies. Addressing film and media scholars in particular, McPherson observes: “With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment <em>about</em> technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge <em>in and through</em> our objects of study” (120). This textbook is inspired by McPherson’s observation.<a href="why.html#fnref21" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn22"><p>In studies of language, rhetoric, and communication, persuasion is frequently approached through three types of appeals: to logos (reason or logic), ethos (ethics, or credibility of the writer), and pathos (emotion). See the <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/establishing_arguments/rhetorical_strategies.html">Purdue Online Writing Lab</a> for more.<a href="why.html#fnref22" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p>Jerome McGann’s “Texts in N-Dimensions and Interpretation in a New Key” (2003) is informative here: “Textuality is a dynamic space that can be organized in an indefinite number of perspectives. A particular ‘object of interpretation’ comes forward as an object when it has been framed for interpretive attention. In that moment it collapses into an eigenstate—so called because the thing being measured and the measuring parameters are ‘momently forced’ into a condition of equivalence” (15).<a href="why.html#fnref23" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn24"><p>For approaches to text as code, see Mark Marino’s <em>Critical Code Studies</em> (2020). For approaches to types of text in translation, see Basil Hatim and Ian Mason’s <em>Discourse and The Translator</em> (1990). For approaches to types of text across media, see <em>Narrative across Media</em> (2004), edited by Marie-Laure Ryan.<a href="why.html#fnref24" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p>Lupton (2010) writes: “Although many books define the purpose of typography as enhancing the readability of the written word, one of design’s most humane functions is, in actuality, to help readers <em>avoid</em> reading” (87). Elsewhere, Robert Bringhurst (1992, 2012) argues that “typography should . . . invite the reader into the text [and] induce a state of energetic repose, which is the ideal condition for reading” (24).<a href="why.html#fnref25" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn26"><p>Since we are studying <em>Undertale</em> later in the book, I am having some fun here. Papyrus is not only a typeface but also a character in that game.<a href="why.html#fnref26" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn27"><p>Lupton (2010) writes: “Typographic grids are all about control. They establish a system for arranging content within the space of a page, screen, or the built environment. Designed in response to the internal pressures of content (text, image, data) and the outer edge or frame (page, screen, window), an effective grid is not a rigid formula but a flexible and resilient structure, a skeleton that moves in concert with the muscular mass of information” (151). For a now famous poetic experiment with the grid, see Stéphane Mallarmé’s <em>Un coup de dés jamais n’abolira le hasard</em> (<em>A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</em>) (1897).<a href="why.html#fnref27" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn28"><p>Two examples here are Abzû (2016, Giant Squid), an adventure game and diving simulator, and <em>Prey</em> (Bethesda, 2017), a first-person shooter with an interface that rarely relies on text.<a href="why.html#fnref28" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn29"><p>See W.J.T. Mitchell on “Addressing Media” (2008).<a href="why.html#fnref29" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn30"><p>See Williams’s “From Medium to Social Practice” (1977) here.<a href="why.html#fnref30" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn31"><p>This constant improvement of technologies is a form of “planned obsolescence.” The quality of media could always be higher; the resolution of your computer monitor could always be better. Technologies are made to be updated and ultimately break, prompting people to purchase new ones. For more, see Giles Slade’s <em>Made to Break</em> (2006) and Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s <em>Planned Obsolescence</em> (2011).<a href="why.html#fnref31" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
