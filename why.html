<p>Making records with media is now quite familiar, as audio, image, and text files function routinely as evidence. “I was there.” “I saw this.” “I heard that.” “I completed the form.” “I submit to you Exhibit A.” From this perspective, media are traces of otherwise ephemeral events: they help people point to the past, keep it found, track it, study it, circulate it, comment on it, and even leverage it. Yet media are not just files. They are practices, too, often entwined with the language of seizure and extraction. <em>Take</em> a video. <em>Capture</em> some audio. <em>Search</em> for text. <em>Grab</em> the image before it’s gone. And, of course, they (plural) are used by the media (singular) to report news around the world.</p>
<p>Media are everywhere, and knowing how and why records are made with them is incredibly important today. They are fundamental to how people relate. They are also history machines: they correspond with the past and play a pivotal role in reproducing it. They should not, however, be reduced to matters of evidence and extraction alone, hence the title of this book, which makes room for fiction at the media table.</p>
<p><em>Contemporary Media and Fiction</em> is an open-access textbook for undergraduate students who are interested in the intersections of audio, image, text, and Anglophone fiction since 2000. What do people imagine with media? How do audio, images, and text tell stories on their own and together? How is fiction read but also watched, played, seen, and heard? How does action itself become a medium? With such questions in mind, the following chapters engage comics, games, podcasts, short stories, novels, and more. In each case, media are snapshots of history <em>and</em> sites of conjecture—information as well as communication; not seized or extracted, but designed and composed; not only documenting what happened, but speculating what did or could.</p>
<p>Records are made and so, too, are fictions.</p>

<p>Before you begin this chapter, you will need access to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><a href="https://www.yhchang.com/THE_MOOD_OF_THE_MOMENT_V.html"><em>M00D 0F THE M0MENT</em></a> (2007), by Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries;<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://even-kei.itch.io/secrets-agent"><em>Secrets Agent</em></a> (2014), by Marina Kittaka;</li>
<li>A text editor, such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>; and,</li>
<li>If you wish, the <a href="chapter1Audio.zip">ZIP archive</a> of this chapter’s audio downloaded to your computer. This way, you will not need to listen to the book in your web browser. To facilitate listening in sequence, I named all the files to correspond with their chapter sections: <code>1_0_0intro.mp3</code>, <code>1_1_0before.mp3</code>, and <code>1_3_1textAgent.mp3</code>, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, I recommend starting this chapter by first scanning all the lists that appear in point form and also reading and/or listening to the <a href="why.html#key-points">Key Points</a>. Doing so should provide you with a gist of the chapter before you dig into the particulars. As you proceed through the chapter, you can consult the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> when the terms I am using are new or unclear and the footnotes when you want to follow the book’s breadcrumbs and learn more about related materials, including the scholarship and fiction that inform the observations I am rehearsing. When you finish the chapter, you may want to read all the footnotes and identify which breadcrumbs especially interest you.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no need to worry about the intricacies of text editors (such as Sublime and Atom) if you are new to them. I address those details in Chapter 3, <a href="blog.html">“Making a Simple Blog.”</a> You can rely on the instructions in <a href="why.html#prompts-1a">“Prompts 1A”</a> for now.</p>

<p>If media are indeed everywhere, then they are difficult to define. Here I humbly submit one possible definition, intended primarily for the purposes of this book but supported by scholarship and, I hope, applicable to other contexts.</p>
<p>Media are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Material agents</em> for turning this into that,<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>labour and techniques</em> involved in working with those agents,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>social practices</em> made durable through those agents,<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>experiences</em> of engaging with those agents, and <a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
<li>The <em>cultures and values</em> entwined with those agents.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that I am not addressing <em>the</em> media, journalism, or mass communication in this definition. These areas are beyond the scope of this textbook, even if they may, and do, frequently overlap with studies of contemporary media and fiction.</p>
<p>Media are often conflated with technologies as well.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> I wish to avoid such conflation in this book if only for the sake of consistency and clarity in delineation.</p>
<p>Technologies:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Are social, cultural, and material <em>systems for reproducing media</em>, and</li>
<li>Include, for instance, print for text, photography for images, phonography for audio, and computing for all three.</li>
</ol>
<p>This definition acknowledges the relationship between media and technologies without assuming they are synonymous. It also proves useful for understanding how media are interpreted within the field of media studies.</p>
<p>I admit that both of these definitions are rather abstract, so I will elaborate on them in this section with text as my example. You may notice that, in treating text as a medium, I am not speaking broadly of “the text” as you may typically do in English class: as a methodological field where any object or event, from a book to a film to a building to a wrestling match, is “the text” subject to interpretation.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> I begin instead with the more narrow premise that media, including text, are material agents.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>When people hear the word, “text,” they may think of sequences or strings of characters used to transform what is thought or spoken into words presented on a page or screen.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> This book is composed mostly of text, and this paragraph is a block of characters, which include letters as well as punctuation marks, numbers, and . . . spaces. Indeed, my operating system produces what’s called an ASCII or Unicode character whenever I press the spacebar on my computer’s keyboard.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Figure 1.1 offers an example, where I converted the string, “Contemporary Media and Fiction,” into decimals. <code>032</code> is the ASCII decimal value for <code></code> (a space), <code>77</code> for <code>M</code>, <code>109</code> for <code>m</code>, and so on.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<hr />
<div class="figure">
<img src="media/1_1ascii.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">FIGURE 1.1: “Contemporary Media and Fiction” converted into ASCII decimal values. <code>032</code> is a space in the string of characters.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>These decimal values are stored in bytes on a disk or computer drive. If I print them, they are stored in ink on paper. That’s a rather banal observation with some significant consequences.</p>
<p>Text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is an agent for transformation (“turning this into that”),</li>
<li>May be intended for multiple destinations, including page and screen; and</li>
<li>May be stored across a variety of locations, from a local drive to the cloud to ink on paper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes storage and display are collocated, if not collapsed. When I open a print novel, for instance, I trust the words will be there, even if the pages are torn or I spilled coffee on them (see Figure 1.2). Yet I may not presume as much with electricity and computers, where storage and display are separate mechanisms.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> The server for this book may not respond, or my laptop battery may be dead. A computer may also intervene in my writing. Software may crash, or, as I type, my word processor may format text against my intentions.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> People notice media the most during moments like these. Connections are down. Work is lost. Rhythm and flow are interrupted.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> My phone has once again auto-corrected my name to “Dysentery.”</p>

</div>
<hr />
<p>While these technical details may not be thrilling, they highlight how text is a means with some substance, like film for photography or marble for sculpture. This attention to substance may help us to better grasp text’s various functions as a material agent.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Text as a material agent is a messenger or carrier. This is most obvious when text becomes a verb: I text friends messages and assume they are in receipt. I trust the agent until I encounter hiccups or glitches. Whether the messages are actually read, or understood as intended, is an entirely different matter.</li>
<li>Text as a material agent is subject to time and weather. Draft chapters printed on stacks of paper are fading on the sun-exposed shelves of my office, and the files for this book will gradually degrade. Print or electronic, text inevitably rots and decays.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> It’s an agent with—not a form or tool outside—history, precisely because it is a means with some substance.<br />
</li>
<li>Text as a material agent is “remediated.”<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Consider finding a Courier typeface from 1955 in your word processor, a searchable edition of Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em> from 1888 on the Internet Archive, or a QWERTY typewriter layout from 1878 on your keyboard (see Figure 1.3).<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> Media age, but they morph and mutate, too, as computers evidently absorb all the things to reduce the friction of past designs—to render history user-friendly in the present. I can type much faster on my laptop from 2018 than with a typewriter from 1955; nevertheless; computers contain more parts and features, which must be maintained and updated regularly. I encounter more and more media on my laptop as the past appears immediate through it.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></li>
</ol>

</div>
<hr />
<p>These three observations bring me to the first key point of this chapter: <em>people instill their trust in media and use them as means for transforming this into that; however, since media are material agents, they cannot be completely controlled.</em> They rot, decay, morph, and mutate, and they may interrupt rhythm and flow through disconnections, glitches, bugs, and automated interventions. To repurpose William Morris’s remark, which has been paraphrased by hundreds of scholars, including scholars of text: “You can’t have media without resistance in the material.”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> Morris apparently said “art,” not “media,” but, again, I am beginning this inquiry with a more narrow focus on the stuff of agents.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Here, I am indebted to Matthew Fuller’s <em>Media Ecologies</em> (2005), especially Chapter 3, “How This Becomes That,” as well as Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin’s <em>Remediation</em> (1999) and N. Katherine Hayles’s <em>Writing Machines</em> (2002), designed by Anne Burdick. Bolter and Grusin reiterate the material dimensions of media by attending to acts of borrowing and adaptation: “When artists or technicians create the apparatus for a new medium, they do so with reference to previous media, borrowing and adapting materials and techniques whenever possible” (68). Meanwhile, Hayles argues for the centrality of materiality to literary studies: “Materiality of the artifact can no longer be positioned as a subspecialty within literary studies; it must be central, for without it we have little hope of forging a robust and nuanced account of how literature is changing under the impact of information technologies” (19). Hayles’s method is “media-specific analysis” (MSA): “In calling for MSA, I do not mean to advocate that media should be considered in isolation from one another. On the contrary, media constantly engage in a recursive dynamic of imitating each other, incorporating aspects of competing media into themselves while simultaneously flaunting the advantages their own forms of mediation offer” (30).<a href="why.html#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Questions of labour are frequently associated with the everydayness of media. See, for instance, Lisa Nakamura (2014): “the everydayness of digital media will require us to pay more attention to the media platforms and communities, digital and otherwise, where so many of us live our lives.” Also see Vicki Mayer on labour (2017).<a href="why.html#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>Raymond Williams’s “From Medium to Social Practice” in <em>Marxism and Literature</em> (1977) is key to understanding media’s relation to language and social practices as are the work of Lisa Gitelman (2006) and Susan Leigh Star (1989 with Griesemer; 2000 with Bowker). Gitelman: “I define media as socially realized structures of communication, where structures include both technological forms and their associated protocols, and where communication is a cultural practice, a ritualized collocation of different people on the same mental map, sharing or engaged with popular ontologies of representation” (7).<a href="why.html#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Wendy Hui Kyong Chun demonstrates the centrality of media to the experience of memory in particular, referring to digital media as the “enduring ephemeral” (95). The notion of experience is also frequently associated with aesthetics, where Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction” (1935) proves to be important. See Benjamin’s collection of essays, <em>Illuminations</em>, edited by Hannah Arendt.<a href="why.html#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>Key historical works here include <em>Culture, Media, Language: Working Papers in Cultural Studies, 1972-79</em> (1980; 2005), edited by Stuart Hall <em>et al.</em>, and John Berger’s <em>Ways of Seeing</em> (1972). More recent publications include <em>Media/Cultural Studies: Critical Approaches</em> (2009), edited by Rhonda Hammer and Douglas Kellner, and Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum’s <em>Values at Play in Digital Games</em> (2014).<a href="why.html#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p>For instance, as Paul Jones (1998) notes in his analysis of debates between Marshall McLuhan and Raymond Williams, McLuhan “systematically conflates” media and technology in <em>Understanding Media</em> (1964), especially in Chapter 1, “The Medium Is the Message.” The two terms were often interchangeable for McLuhan.<a href="why.html#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p>Roland Barthes is especially well known for approaching text as a methodological field. See “From Work to Text” in <em>Image-Music-Text</em> (1977) and <em>Mythologies</em> (1957, 1972), including “The World of Wrestling.” Aspects of Barthes’s scholarship are frequently associated with “media semiotics,” which attends to the roles media play in symbols and signification.<a href="why.html#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p>Responding to Barthes, Hayles writes the following in <em>Writing Machines</em> (2002): “In positioning text against work, Barthes was among those who initiated semiotic and performative approaches to discourse, arguably one of the most important developments in literary studies in the last century. But this shift has entailed loss as well as gain. Useful as the vocabulary of text was in expanding textuality beyond the printed page, it also had the effect, in treating everything from fashion to fascism as a semiotic system, of eliding differences in materiality. Perhaps now, after the linguistic turn has yielded so many important insights, it is time to turn again to a careful consideration of what difference the materiality of the medium makes” (30).<a href="why.html#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p>In <em>Thinking with Type</em>, Ellen Lupton defines text via typography: “In typography, ‘text’ is defined as an ongoing sequence of words, distinct from shorter headlines and or caption. The main block is often called ‘the body,’ comprising the principal mass of content. Also known as ‘running text,’ it can flow from one page, column, or box to another. Text can be viewed as a thing—a sound and sturdy object—or a fluid poured into the containers of page or screen” (87).<a href="why.html#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>ASCII stands for “American Standard Code for Information Interchange.”<a href="why.html#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>This entire process is technically more complex than my explanation here. For more details, see <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/computer-systems/0/steps/53503">“Pressing a Key”</a> by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, published by FutureLearn.<a href="why.html#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p>Hayles writes the following in <em>My Mother Was a Computer</em> (2005): “With electronic texts, the data files may be on one server and the machine creating the display may be in another location entirely, which means that electronic text exists as a distributed phenomenon” (101). For more on the importance of storage and inscription to media studies, see Matthew Kirschenbaum’s <em>Mechanisms: New Media and the Forensic Imagination</em>, including his distinction between “formal” and “forensic” materiality (2008).<a href="why.html#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p>If you are interested in a history of word processing, then see Kirschenbaum’s <em>Track Changes</em> (2017).<a href="why.html#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s research, including <em>Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</em> (1990), is often mentioned in this context. Also relevant is Henri Lefebvre’s <em>Rhythmanalysis: Space, Time, and Everyday Life</em> (1992; 2004).<a href="why.html#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>For a fascinating case study here, see Porter Olsen’s “Emulation as Mimicry: Reading the Salman Rushdie Digital Archive” (2019), which engages the technical and colonial dimensions of emulation, a technique often used to preserve text and writing environments.<a href="why.html#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>Bolter and Grusin’s <em>Remediation</em> (1999) is important here, particularly what they call the “double logic of remediation”: “Our culture wants to both multiply its media and to erase all traces of mediation” (5). Remediation thus involves a consideration of both hypermediacy and immediacy.<a href="why.html#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>You can read an 1888 edition of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein: Or, The Modern Prometheus</em> at the <a href="https://archive.org/details/frankensteinorm02shelgoog/page/n6/mode/2up">Internet Archive</a>.<a href="why.html#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>Again, this is what Bolter and Grusin (1999) call the “double logic of remediation.” Also see Chun’s notion of the “enduring ephemeral” in <em>Programmed Visions</em> (2011).<a href="why.html#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn19"><p>For an account of Morris’s remark, see Bethany Nowviskie’s “Resistance in the Materials” (2013): “It’s a compelling line—reproduced (somewhat mechanically and often slightly mangled) all over, and only rarely contextualized or traced back to its source. Morris’s erstwhile son-in-law, Henry Halliday Sparling, reports it in a 1924 study of the Kelmscott Press, as part of the designer’s extended complaint about a newfangled device: the typewriter.”<a href="why.html#fnref19" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
