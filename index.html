<h1>About this Book</h1>
<p>How do we not only <em>read</em> fiction but also <em>see</em>, <em>play</em>, <em>watch</em>, and <em>listen</em> to it? This textbook introduces you to ways of approaching audio, image, text, and interaction in Anglophone fiction since 2000. It draws upon primary sources published across a variety of formats, from short stories, novels, and comics to games, podcasts, and animations. Chapter 1 defines “media” and “fiction” and explains the motivations for the book. Chapter 2 presents you with a framework, called “media aesthetics,” for interpreting contemporary media and fiction, and Chapter 3 shows you how to publish media and criticism online by making a simple blog. Chapters 4 - 7 develop the material presented in Chapters 1 - 3 by detailing particular approaches to audio, image, text, and action, respectively. Chapter 8 concludes the book by addressing possible next steps for media and fiction studies, with particular attention to how this textbook may apply to your own research and interests. Along the way, we will engage work by Sam Barlow, Alison Bechdel, Temmie Chang, Jeffrey Cranor, Mary Epworth, Extremely Ok Games, Toby Fox, the Fullbright Company, Nalo Hopkinson, N.K. Jemisin, Marina Kittaka, Janina Matthewson, Brenda Neotenomie, Porpentine, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Amanda Strong, Rob Wittig, and Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries. I will assume you have no previous experience with media studies or media practice.</p>
<p><strong>Intended Audience</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this open-access textbook for undergraduate students who are interested in the Humanities. I hope you find it useful regardless of your major or minor. I rely on it for a few of my English courses at the University of Victoria (UVic), and it was inspired partly by British Columbia’s new curriculum, including <a href="https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/english-language-arts/12/new-media">“New Media”</a> in English Language Arts and <a href="https://curriculum.gov.bc.ca/curriculum/arts-education/12/media-arts">“Media Arts”</a> in Arts Education. It is intended for integration with work happening across the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/">Department of English</a>, the <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/index.php">Faculty of Humanities</a>, the <a href="https://uvicpraxis.github.io/">Praxis Studio</a>, <a href="https://www.uvic.ca/library/locations/home/spcoll/">Special Collections</a>, and the <a href="https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/dsc/">Digital Scholarship Commons</a> at UVic; however, it is licensed (CC BY-NC) for distribution, use, and adaptation elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Primary Sources</strong></p>
<p>Primary sources for this book are works of fiction published mostly in English since 2000. I provide you with URLs for all of them, but some are not openly available online. I contributed to artists’ Patreon accounts (or the like) where applicable, and I encourage you to do the same if you can. I point as well to relevant secondary sources, such as literary criticism and media history, usually in the footnotes. To reduce required bandwidth and the likelihood of disappearing content, I do not embed remotely hosted audio, images, or video in this book. The use of all materials abides by fair dealing provisions in the Canadian <em>Copyright Act</em>, and the <a href="references.html">References</a> page follows MLA (Modern Language Association, Edition 8) style.</p>
<p>The content of this book is meant for instruction. I refrain from heavy quotation and paraphrasing to present a student-friendly introduction to contemporary media and fiction. In each chapter, I stage primary sources for you by dedicating sections to them, and I provide you with a breadcrumb trail of related research in the footnotes. Here, my hope is to avoid perpetuating impostor syndrome. This book neither assumes nor presents a canon of “must-know” works. It instead encourages you to participate in media and fiction studies as ongoing practices and active conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong></p>
<p>As an introduction to contemporary media and fiction, the breadth, depth, and reach of this textbook are limited in several ways. The chapters focus on only twenty years of material primarily from the Global North, and I rarely address important precursors, such as histories of manuscripts, photography, phonography, print, and film. The introductory nature of the textbook also means that each topic, from the values of media and the design of fiction to the particulars of a certain genre or format, could be a book or course unto itself. The chapters thus tend to spark inquiry rather than encouraging domain specialization. Additionally, I bypass binaries, such as digital / analog and electronic / print media, commonly found in scholarship. I hope this decision enriches, rather than forecloses, current conversations about what media and fiction are and what they can do. Finally, the book is clearly limited by my focus on English, which has been not only an instrument of colonization and empire but also a means for policing how media and fiction are practiced. Language plays a pivotal role in this book, and approaches through languages other than English would yield very different, and no doubt important, results.</p>
<p><strong>Prompts</strong></p>
<p>Each chapter of this book includes prompts for you to engage media and fiction together through brief blog entries. They privilege demonstration of knowledge over exam-based accountability. “A” prompts address primary sources discussed in the textbook, while “B” prompts nudge you to integrate your own interests and experiences into the interpretive process. All prompts are intended for classroom use, and I wrote them with repurposing in mind (CC BY-NC).</p>
<p><strong>Audio Files</strong></p>
<p>For most sections of this textbook, I produced audio files that correspond with the text. The idea here is to render the book more accessible. The audio files function like recorded lectures (with the text serving as a script) and may stand on their own, yet they may be more instructive when heard while reading. Either way, they are not essential and rarely provide additional context or information.</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jentery Sayers, and I am an Associate Professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought at UVic, where I teach courses in American literature, media and cultural studies, materialism, and prototyping. I have been at UVic since 2011, and I founded the Maker Lab in the Humanities, which is now the Praxis Studio. I earned a BS and BA from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, and my MA and PhD in English from the University of Washington in Seattle. I am the editor of three books: <em>Making Things and Drawing Boundaries</em> (University of Minnesota Press, 2017), <em>The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities</em> (Routledge, 2018), and <em>Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities</em> (Modern Language Association, with Davis, Gold, and Harris, 2020). You can contact me at <a href="mailto:jentery@uvic.ca">jentery@uvic.ca</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong></p>
<p>This textbook is published and maintained by the <a href="https://uvicpraxis.github.io/">Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies</a>, which I direct at UVic. All student contributions to the book were funded by UVic English or UVic’s Work Study program; no student work was performed without compensation. The book is currently available only in HTML, at <a href="https://jntry.work/cmf/">jntry.work/cmf/</a>, with plans for EPUB, MOBI, and PDF in the near future (2021-22).</p>
<p><strong>Software</strong></p>
<p>I wrote this textbook in Markdown with Sublime Text, built it using <a href="https://bookdown.org/">Bookdown</a> in RStudio, and published it to my host via SFTP. A repository for the project is available in GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/uvicpraxis/cmf">github.com/uvicpraxis/cmf</a>. Audio from each chapter is unavailable in GitHub at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Syllabus</strong></p>
<p>Should you be interested in an example syllabus, then please see <a href="https://jentery.github.io/engl230/">English 230: “Contemporary Media and Fiction”</a> (Fall 2020; 60 students) at UVic. This course was designed so that it may be completed asynchronously, and it relies heavily on this textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></p>
