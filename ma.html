<p>Chapter 1 was about <em>why</em> we might study contemporary media and fiction. I defined “media” and “fiction” along the way, and then I elaborated on how—when combined—the two draw attention to seven key elements of communication: situation, composition, audience, norms, novelty, engagement, and design (SCANNED). From there, we looked to two examples to enrich our understanding of SCANNED: Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries’s <em>M00D 0F THE M0MENT</em> and Marina Kittaka’s <em>Secrets Agent</em>. These examples demonstrated the incredible range of how people approach contemporary media, and also how the collocation of audio, image, text, and action expands the meanings and functions of fiction.</p>
<p>This chapter shifts from <em>why</em> to <em>how</em> via an approach called “media aesthetics,” or <em>the practice of evaluating how the design and content of media and fiction are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced</em>. I explain what all of that means in the sections below.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember for now is that media aesthetics takes seriously the combination of experience with understanding, or <em>sense with making sense</em>. As agents, techniques, values, and social practices made durable (see Chapter 1), media are all about mediation: processes and things in the middle. Importantly, mediation is not necessarily a humanist (or human-centric) concept. Human perception is shaped and disciplined by media, and it is defined in relation to what people engage and how they engage each other. What’s therefore especially interesting about media aesthetics is the degree to which the particulars of media and embodied experiences remain opaque or unfamiliar to us.</p>
<p>As you may recall from Chapter 1, media cannot be controlled completely. They do not always do what we want or expect, and they are subject to the stuff of time, space, and technologies. They rely heavily on trust. Crafting or interpreting work with them does not require seeing or understanding everything they do. The same goes for other people, if you think about it. I may be able to sympathize with and trust another person, but I can never inhabit their position. I will never fully know what someone else thinks or experience exactly what they are experiencing. Perhaps this is one reason why so many fictions speculate about lived experiences, from first-person perspectives in games to fantasy worlds in novels to imaginary characters in comics. Fiction uses media to project worlds and conjecture about possible experiences, and those experiences have their own politics and aesthetics, from which we may learn even if we can never inhabit them.</p>

<li>Your response to a prompt found in Chapter 1, <a href="why.html#prompts-1a">“Prompts 1A”</a>, if only to avoid falling behind in the writing process;</li>
<li>A text editor, such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>; and,</li>
<li>If you wish, the ZIP archive (coming soon) of this chapter’s audio downloaded to your computer. This way, you will not need to listen to the book in your web browser. To facilitate listening in sequence, I named all the files to correspond with their chapter sections: <code>2_0_0intro.mp3</code> and <code>2_1_0before.mp3</code>, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, I recommend starting this chapter by first scanning all the lists that appear in point form and also reading and/or listening to the <a href="why.html#key-points">Key Points</a>. Doing so should provide you with a gist of the chapter before you dig into the particulars. As you proceed through the chapter, you can consult the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> when the terms I am using are new or unclear and the footnotes when you want to follow the book’s breadcrumbs and learn more about related materials, including the scholarship and fiction that inform the observations I am rehearsing. When you finish the chapter, you may want to read all the footnotes and identify which breadcrumbs especially interest you.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no need to worry about the intricacies of text editors (such as Sublime and Atom) if you are new to them. I address those details in Chapter 3, <a href="blog.html">“Making a Simple Blog.”</a> You can rely on the instructions in <a href="#prompts-2a">“Prompts 2A”</a> for now.</p>

<p>Before we discuss media aesthetics, I want to take a moment to consider how media are measured in fiction: how they are divided into components that are isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. A mechanism for the production of such components is called an “apparatus,” and it matters because it shapes how media and fiction are made and interpreted, not to mention what people expect of them.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of an apparatus:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Grids</em>: They produce panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software. They usually encourage people to scan a surface, read in a sequence (from left to right, for example), and juxtapose two or more components (two side-by-side images, for instance).</li>
<li><em>Stacks</em>: They produce a “front end” and “back end” as well as layers or strata of a project (such as storage, databases, code, and interfaces). They usually encourage people to think in terms of depth and visibility: the code of a project may be invisible or hidden, for example, or code may be the “source” of the content. Most online projects involve some sort of stack.</li>
<li><em>Networks</em>: They produce paths, maps, branches, and nodes. They usually encourage people to follow links, graph or visualize relations between contributors, and even wander and get lost. You can think of web browsing in these terms: you may wander from site to site, page to page, in ways that differ from reading a book, which has chapters, numbered pages, and whatnot. Networks tend to encourage a lot of “bouncing,” or jumping from one bit of content to the next.<br />
</li>
<li><em>Editors</em>: They produce tracks, fades, cuts, clips, frames, and various kinds of effects. Editors are common in the production of audio, video, image, and text files, and you probably have all sorts of editing software on your computer. Editors usually encourage people to synchronize media (such as synchronizing text with audio in captions), filter and process them (in Photoshop or on your phone, for instance), and engage them simultaneously (watching moving images and listening to audio at the same time, for example).</li>
<li><em>Engines</em>: They produce environments for interaction and storytelling. Think of the Holodeck in <em>Star Trek</em> (see Figure 2.1). It is not an actual engine; however, it is a popular representation of one. It builds or renders a world—call it “virtual,” if you wish—for characters such as Commander Will Riker and Data the android to enter and inhabit. Today, the most common engines are game engines that generate physics, graphics, audio, logic, and artificial intelligence in games. This means multiple games can be built with the same engine and may thus resemble each other in various ways, particularly where action is concerned.</li>
</ul>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>These apparatuses of course overlap and intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people’s engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they are inside a program, theatre, or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It is there, with palpable consequences, yet it is rarely tangible or tactile. It is meant to recede from attention or run in the background.</p>
<p>Attention to apparatuses also has clear implications for design, including the design of fiction. Consider the following list, which uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with them to describe components and experiences common in particular genres. These prepositions offer an alternative, if you will, to the list above, and may assist in the description of how media and fiction engage us, or how we relate to them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>At</em> (spectacle): privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in action and adventure genres</li>
<li><em>Within</em> (worldbuilding): privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying genres</li>
<li><em>Between</em> (texture): privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in strategy, comedy, and detective fiction genres</li>
<li><em>Across</em> (deferral): privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense genres</li>
<li><em>Beyond</em> (epic): privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction</li>
<li><em>To</em> (address): privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in simulation and coming-of-age genres</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not recipes for genres, and this section is not an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture everything about genre). It is simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus, and for beginning work in media aesthetics. It also brings me to the first key point of this chapter: <em>An apparatus helps to measure and produce relations that influence how people sense and make sense of media and fiction. These relations may be described through frameworks (such as grids and stacks) or prepositions (like “at” for spectacle or “to” for address).</em></p>
