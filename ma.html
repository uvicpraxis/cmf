<p>Chapter 1 was about <em>why</em> we might study contemporary media and fiction. I defined “media” and “fiction” along the way, and then I elaborated on how—when combined—the two draw attention to seven key elements of communication: situation, composition, audience, norms, novelty, engagement, and design (SCANNED). From there, we looked to two examples to enrich our understanding of SCANNED: Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries’s <em>M00D 0F THE M0MENT</em> and Marina Kittaka’s <em>Secrets Agent</em>. These examples demonstrated the incredible range of how people approach contemporary media, and also how the collocation of audio, image, text, and action expands the meanings and functions of fiction.</p>
<p>This chapter shifts from <em>why</em> to <em>how</em> via an approach called “media aesthetics,” or <em>the practice of evaluating how the design and content of media and fiction are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced</em>. I explain what all of that means in the sections below.</p>
<p>The important thing to remember for now is that media aesthetics takes seriously the combination of experience with understanding, or <em>sense with making sense</em>. As agents, techniques, values, and social practices made durable (see Chapter 1), media are all about mediation: processes and things in the middle. Importantly, mediation is not necessarily a humanist (or human-centric) concept. Human perception is shaped and disciplined by media, and it is defined in relation to what people engage and how they engage each other. What’s therefore especially interesting about media aesthetics is the degree to which the particulars of media and embodied experiences remain opaque or unfamiliar to us.</p>
<p>As you may recall from Chapter 1, media cannot be controlled completely. They do not always do what we want or expect, and they are subject to the stuff of time, space, and technologies. They rely heavily on trust. Crafting or interpreting work with them does not require seeing or understanding everything they do. The same goes for other people, if you think about it. I may be able to sympathize with and trust another person, but I can never inhabit their position. I will never fully know what someone else thinks or experience exactly what they are experiencing. Perhaps this is one reason why so many fictions speculate about lived experiences, from first-person perspectives in games to fantasy worlds in novels to imaginary characters in comics. Fiction uses media to project worlds and conjecture about possible experiences, and those experiences have their own politics and aesthetics, from which we may learn even if we can never inhabit them.</p>

<li>Your response to a prompt found in Chapter 1, <a href="why.html#prompts-1a">“Prompts 1A”</a>, if only to avoid falling behind in the writing process;</li>
<li>A text editor, such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>; and,</li>
<li>If you wish, the ZIP archive (coming soon) of this chapter’s audio downloaded to your computer. This way, you will not need to listen to the book in your web browser. To facilitate listening in sequence, I named all the files to correspond with their chapter sections: <code>2_0_0intro.mp3</code> and <code>2_1_0before.mp3</code>, for example.</li>
</ol>
<p>As always, I recommend starting this chapter by first scanning all the lists that appear in point form and also reading and/or listening to the <a href="ma.html#key-points-1">Key Points</a>. Doing so should provide you with a gist of the chapter before you dig into the particulars. As you proceed through the chapter, you can consult the <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a> when the terms I am using are new or unclear and the footnotes when you want to follow the book’s breadcrumbs and learn more about related materials, including the scholarship and fiction that inform the observations I am rehearsing. When you finish the chapter, you may want to read all the footnotes and identify which breadcrumbs especially interest you.</p>
<p>Finally, there is no need to worry about the intricacies of text editors (such as Sublime and Atom) if you are new to them. I address those details in Chapter 3, <a href="blog.html">“Making a Simple Blog.”</a> You can rely on the instructions in <a href="#prompts-2a">“Prompts 2A”</a> for now.</p>

<p>Before we discuss media aesthetics, I want to take a moment to consider how media are measured in fiction: how they are divided into components that are isolated, traversed, compared, contrasted, and the like. A mechanism for the production of such components is called an “apparatus,” and it matters because it shapes how media and fiction are made and interpreted, not to mention what people expect of them.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of an apparatus:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Grids</em>: They produce panels and gutters in comics; columns, margins, headers, and lexia on pages; and snap guides in design software. They usually encourage people to scan a surface, read in a sequence (from left to right, for example), and juxtapose two or more components (two side-by-side images, for instance).</li>
<li><em>Stacks</em>: They produce a “front end” and “back end” as well as layers or strata of a project (such as storage, databases, code, and interfaces). They usually encourage people to think in terms of depth and visibility: the code of a project may be invisible or hidden, for example, or code may be the “source” of the content. Most online projects involve some sort of stack.</li>
<li><em>Networks</em>: They produce paths, maps, branches, and nodes. They usually encourage people to follow links, graph or visualize relations between contributors, and even wander and get lost. You can think of web browsing in these terms: you may wander from site to site, page to page, in ways that differ from reading a book, which has chapters, numbered pages, and whatnot. Networks tend to encourage a lot of “bouncing,” or jumping from one bit of content to the next.<br />
</li>
<li><em>Editors</em>: They produce tracks, fades, cuts, clips, frames, and various kinds of effects. Editors are common in the production of audio, video, image, and text files, and you probably have all sorts of editing software on your computer. Editors usually encourage people to synchronize media (such as synchronizing text with audio in captions), filter and process them (in Photoshop or on your phone, for instance), and engage them simultaneously (watching moving images and listening to audio at the same time, for example).</li>
<li><em>Engines</em>: They produce environments for interaction and storytelling. Think of the Holodeck in <em>Star Trek</em> (see Figure 2.1). It is not an actual engine; however, it is a popular representation of one. It builds or renders a world—call it “virtual,” if you wish—for characters such as Commander Will Riker and Data the android to enter and inhabit. Today, the most common engines are game engines that generate physics, graphics, audio, logic, and artificial intelligence in games. This means multiple games can be built with the same engine and may thus resemble each other in various ways, particularly where action is concerned.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<div class="figure">

</div>
<hr />
<p>These apparatuses of course overlap and intersect. Any given web project, for instance, may involve all of them. Equally interesting, an apparatus may not be explicit in people’s engagements with media. The lines of a grid or the graphs for a network rarely appear on page or screen, and an engine usually wants people to forget they are inside a program, theatre, or world. An apparatus is thus more like an interface. It is there, with palpable consequences, yet it is rarely tangible or tactile. It is meant to recede from attention or run in the background.</p>
<p>Attention to apparatuses also has clear implications for design, including the design of fiction. Consider the following list, which uses prepositions to mark relations enabled by apparatuses and then experiments with them to describe components and experiences common in particular genres. These prepositions offer an alternative, if you will, to the list above, and may assist in the description of how media and fiction engage us, or how we relate to them.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>At</em> (spectacle): privileges the coherence of audio, image, and/or text into a single presentation; the story matters less than the experience; spectacles are common in action and adventure genres</li>
<li><em>Within</em> (worldbuilding): privileges the configuration of audio, image, and/or text as components in a system with rules or conventions; a story is played or inhabited; worldbuilding is common in fantasy, science fiction, and roleplaying genres</li>
<li><em>Between</em> (texture): privileges friction or tension between components of audio, image, and/or text; a story emerges from play or ambiguity and may promise resolution; texture is common in strategy, comedy, and detective fiction genres</li>
<li><em>Across</em> (deferral): privileges the use of audio, image, and/or text to make promises and then postpone delivery; the story thrives on what is or could be next; deferral is common in mystery, horror, thrillers, and suspense genres</li>
<li><em>Beyond</em> (epic): privileges pointing to audio, image, and/or text found elsewhere; the story is part of and refers to something larger; epic is common in sagas, encyclopedic fiction, and historical fiction</li>
<li><em>To</em> (address): privileges interpellation (hey you!) or identification (it me!) via components of audio, image, and/or text; address is common in simulation and coming-of-age genres</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not recipes for genres, and this section is not an exercise in totalization (as if one list could capture everything about genre). It is simply a starting point for approaching media in fiction through an apparatus, and for beginning work in media aesthetics. It also brings me to the first key point of this chapter: <em>An apparatus helps to measure and produce relations that influence how people sense and make sense of media and fiction. These relations may be described through frameworks (such as grids ands stacks) or prepositions (like “at” for spectacle or “to” for address).</em></p>

<p>I defined media aesthetics in the introduction to this chapter but will repeat the definition here just in case: <em>the practice of evaluating how the design and content of media and fiction are apprehended, comprehended, synthesized, and reproduced</em>. In this section, I introduce twenty words starting with the letter “m” to facilitate the study of media and fiction through media aesthetics. The list is a guide, not a set of instructions, and will inevitably fall apart with a bit of pressure. That’s ok. A guide is not a solution, and I am not proposing media aesthetics as a solution to anything.</p>
<p>In the list, I avoid common dichotomies between mind and body, logic and feeling, and analysis and experience, mostly because such dichotomies are driven by norms or ideals frequently criticized in media and literary studies. Although there is an order to the list, with “Apprehension” appearing first, it is not a hierarchy or series of steps. The “Evaluation” section may prompt revisions to “Synthesis,” for example, or some people may wish to start with “Comprehension.”</p>
<p>I use “work” throughout the list to refer to a work of fiction and its media (audio, image, text, and action), and I encourage thorough description of works to render the process of media aesthetics as approachable as possible. After the list, I elaborate on each aspect of media aesthetics with more detail for each “m.” See the sections on “Apprehension” (2.5), “Comprehension” (2.6), “Synthesis” (2.7), and “Evaluation” (2.8) for more.</p>
<p><strong>Apprehension</strong></p>
<p><em>“What’s happening here?”</em> Apprehension is about impressions, sensations, and evocations. It’s about the moment, which may be familiar. “I’ve felt this before.” While the experience of media and fiction may feel personal, it’s social, too. It’s structured by norms and values, and it’s shaped by design and history.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the <em>materials</em> used.</li>
<li>Describe the sensory <em>modalities</em> engaged.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>mood</em> inhabited or experienced.</li>
</ul>
<p>When engaging a work of media and fiction for the first time, consider recording or annotating your experience in real time (like an unboxing video or Let’s Play), if only for your own records. With consent, you might do the same for someone else and then compare your results. Account for eye rolls and anxious feelings as well: what’s off-putting, predictable, unclear, discomfiting, frustrating . . . Apprehension isn’t necessarily appreciation.</p>
<p><strong>Comprehension</strong></p>
<p><em>“What’s this all about?”</em> Comprehension is about expressions, understanding, and situating things. It’s about making sense after the fact—identifying and arranging the parts. While it may feel impersonal, it’s nevertheless motivated. People usually want meaning and even purpose from works of media and fiction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the <em>modules</em> or parts of the work.</li>
<li>Describe the units used to <em>measure</em> the work and its parts.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>main content</em> of the story (who, what, when, and where).</li>
<li>Describe the work’s history, its network, what it remediates, and its <em>moment</em> of composition (who, what, when, and where).</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider distilling the work, reflecting on it, and even graphing its parts, story, and/or relation to other works in its network. Note how and when such graphs are about control, or the pleasure of making sense of things. When is control problematic? What do graphs or classifications impose on fiction?</p>
<p><strong>Synthesis</strong></p>
<p><em>“How does it all come together?”</em> Synthesis is about boundaries and relations. It entwines apprehension with comprehension. It connects materials with abstractions and personal experiences with structures and designs. It’s never total or complete; it can’t and shouldn’t account for all the things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe how (you assume) the work was <em>made</em>.</li>
<li>Get <em>meta</em>. Describe how the story is told.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>meaning</em> of the work (or its multiple, incongruous meanings).</li>
<li>Describe how it <em>massages</em> or <em>manipulates</em> people’s senses.</li>
<li>Describe how people <em>move</em> with, within, across, and beyond it.</li>
<li>Describe what <em>motivates</em> people to return to and/or identify with it.</li>
<li>Describe how it and responses to it have <em>morphed</em> over time.</li>
<li>Describe how it is or would be collected and <em>maintained</em> over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to only one or two. Otherwise, the process may be overwhelming. And again, no interpretation is ever complete.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>
<p><em>“So what?”</em> Evaluation is about assessment, or why people should care about the work and engagements with it. Evaluations have intended audiences; knowing that audience and their expectations focuses the inquiry. For whom does the work matter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe how the work <em>mediates</em> its relation to power and “common sense” (norms, assumed knowledge, and habits of perception).</li>
<li>Describe whom and what it <em>misses</em>, ignores, or essentializes.</li>
<li>Describe the <em>memories</em> it elicits and how it elicits them.</li>
<li>Describe how it functions as <em>mimesis</em> (show, drama) and diegesis (tell, narrative) within and against its network.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, consider taking notes for each of these but developing a response to just one or two. A response may not be an essay or series of paragraphs. Compose with audio, image, and/or text to determine what sticks with you and/or what others deem to be most compelling approach.</p>
<p><strong>Action</strong></p>
<p><em>“What to do about it all?”</em> Action is about learning and intervention: what people do with a work of media and fiction they encounter and study. Perhaps they do nothing with it. Preferring not to is indeed a sort of action. But so are improving the work, responding to it, integrating it into a project, discussing it with others, and drawing motivation from it. “Active learning” assumes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Mobilize</em> the work: change it, prototype with it, teach it, critique it, exhibit it, write about it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider how a given work of media and fiction intersects with your own interests and trajectories and then determine how to communicate these intersections to (or with) other people.</p>

<p>When apprehending a work, you may want to consider the materials used. Materials are about the work as matter and physical substance: as an agent that turns this into that.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to think about materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presence: Can you touch or handle it?</li>
<li>Texture: Is it smooth or rough?</li>
<li>Ephemera: What about it disappears, or what’s ghostly or mutable about it?</li>
<li>Visibility: What materials can you see? Not see?</li>
<li>Audibility: Does it make a sound? What materials can you hear?</li>
<li>Packaging: Is it packaged? If so, describe the packaging.</li>
<li>Storage: Where or how is it stored? Can you handle or see the storage media?</li>
<li>Age: How has the work aged? How might it rot, decay, or degrade?</li>
<li>Transformation: How does it turn this into that? What is “this,” and what is “that”?</li>

<p>You may also want to consider the sensory modalities engaged. Sensory modalities are about how people’s bodies are addressed by fiction.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to think about sensory modalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which of the five senses (hearing, seeing, tasting, smelling, and touching) are engaged? Which are engaged more than others?</li>
<li>How is it WOVEN? Consider Written (including reading), Oral (what’s said and heard), Visual (colour, layout, and images, for instance), Electronic (how the work transmits media, and whether it’s electronic), and Nonverbal (gesture, audio, and movement, for instance) communication in the work. (Thanks to Georgia Tech’s Writing and Communication Program for this approach and the acronym, WOVEN.)</li>
<li>What does agency feel like here? Are you moving / engaging with or against the work? Maybe somewhere in between? What’s the flow? Are you in control? Do you want to be?</li>

<p>You may want to consider the mood as well. The mood is about being in the world and engaging fiction. What’s the work’s vibe or feel?</p>
<p>Here are some ways to think about mood:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the work as an encounter. What or whom are you encountering? Does it feel close or distant?</li>
<li>Describe the work as an atmosphere. What’s the “weather” of the work?</li>
<li>Describe the work’s tone. Is it serious? Playful? Vague? Direct? Presumptuous? Subtle?</li>
<li>Describe the work as a feeling. Any goosebumps? What emotions or experiences do you associate with it? What was felt instantly? What took some time?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mood prompts considerations of <em>distance, immediacy, and familiarity</em>.</p>
<p>This section brings me to the second key point of this chapter: <em>Apprehending a work considers the role that materials (stuff or substance), sensory modalities (including attention), and mood (such as feelings of distance, immediacy, and familiarity) play in media and fiction.</em></p>

<p>When comprehending a work, you may want to consider modules, which draw attention to the work’s composition and arrangement.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to think about modules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the work available as a collection of files? If so, describe them. Consider a website, for instance. It may have HTML, CSS, and media files. (More on websites in Chapter 3.)</li>
<li>Describe the component parts of the work, even if they are not available as separate files. Consider podcasts, for instance. Their components may include dialogue (DX), sound effects (SFX), background sound (BG), and music (MX). (More on audio in Chapter 4.) Or, consider comics. Their components may include panels, gutters, tiers, and speech bubbles. (More on comics in Chapter 5.)</li>
<li>Describe how “seamless” the composition appears to be, or where and when you notice the seams that knit together the work’s components. What feels polished? Rough? When is it rough on purpose?</li>

<p>You may also want to consider measurements. To measure is to assess and/or quantify media, fiction, and engagements with them.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to think about measurements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Length: the work as pages, words, or minutes, for example. How would you communicate the length?</li>
<li>Progress: the work as levels or the distance to the end, for example. How would you communicate your progress?</li>
<li>Success: the work as points or a collection, for example. How would you communicate success with respect to your engagement?</li>
<li>Body/Content: the work as chapters, worlds, scenarios, or episodes, for example. How would you communicate the content of the work?</li>
<li>Presentation: the work as its screen (size), resolution, compression, or fidelity, for example. How would you communicate the work’s presentation?</li>
<li>Attention: the work as clicks, views, sales, or ratings, for example. How would you communicate attention to the work?</li>
<li>Engagement: the work as meaningful, interesting, fascinating, or unique, for example. Engagement is difficult, if not impossible, to measure; however, indicators include re-reading, re-watching, re-listening, re-playing, etc.; publications about the work; the work being taught; the work being remastered, ported, or adapted; and communities of fans and/or critics congealing around the work.</li>

</li>
<li>Setting: time, place, and location of the story.</li>

<li>Identify who was (or is) involved in the work. Consider who got credit and for what.</li>
<li>Identify when it was made and circulated. Consider what other kinds of work were popular at that time.</li>
<li>Describe what was happening when it was made and circulated. Consider important historical, cultural, and artistic events as well as what the authors / artists were doing at (or around) the time.</li>
<li>Describe where the work was made and circulated. Consider its network, geographic location, and “scene.” In some cases, the network may be quite literal: a radio or tv network, for instance. In others, it may be social, including communities of authors, artists, editors, critics, and fans.</li>
<li>Describe its reception over time. Compare its reception now with its reception then. Also consider reception across different venues or groups of people.</li>
<li>Describe what it remediates. Consider previous media, technologies, and formats that it absorbed or rendered more accessible in its moment. Also consider “skeuomorphs,” or objects with functions (such as wastebaskets) that become ornamental features (like the “trash” icon on my laptop) in the work.</li>

<p>When synthesizing your apprehension and comprehension of a work, you may want to consider how the work was made. How did it come together? How did this become that? Of note, it’s pretty much impossible to fully capture and describe this process, even if you can access, say, notes, documentation, or designer diaries.</p>
<p>But here are some ways to determine or conjecture how a work was made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visit a collection in person or online. Libraries, archives, and museums often have materials describing and/or documenting how works were made.</li>
<li>Use the Wayback Machine or a similar service to compare versions of a work over time. (See “Morphed” below, too.)</li>
<li>Read blogs and the like. Maybe those involved in the work shared their process in writing, through video, etc.</li>
<li>Imitate the work. Make your own personal copy of it and document the process along the way.</li>
<li>Deconstruct the work. If possible, take it apart, put it back together, and document the process along the way.</li>
<li>Go backwards. Start at the end, work your way to the beginning, and document the process (or experience) along the way.</li>

<ul>
<li>Situation: What’s known or taken for granted in the work? How do characters understand each other (or so we assume)?</li>
<li>World: What’s the scope and scale of the setting and its systems, history, mythologies, and/or landscape? How is the world of the work bigger or more expansive than the story itself?</li>
<li>Duration: How long does the story take to communicate certain things? How does it use abbreviation, summary, stretched time, or warped time? What moves quickly? What doesn’t?</li>
<li>Frequency: What’s repeated in the work? What are its patterns or textures?</li>
<li>Sequencing: How is the work arranged chronologically and non-chronologically? How does it flash-forward (“prolepsis”) or flash-back (“analepsis”)? How does it use leveling, achievements, or progressive disclosure? How does the story branch?</li>
<li>Evocation: How does the work draw on memories and resemblances? What aspects of the past, and whose past, does it evoke?</li>
<li>Focalization: How do we get our knowledge from characters and/or narrators (zero = omniscient narrator who knows more than characters, internal = narrator is a character and thus knows what the character knows, and external focalization = narrator or camera eye telling less than what characters know)?</li>
<li>Narration: How is the story told? A narrative often involves abstract (summary), orientation (time and place), complicating action, resolution (climax), evaluation (commentary or elucidation), and coda (time of story meets time of narrative).</li>

Do you need to access them in person or on site (in a library or archive)? What’s not online, and why? What’s not “open” or freely available, and why? When and why might accessing the work in its original format(s) matter?</li>
<li>Describe how these formats “rot” or degrade over time. How long have they been around? What might replace them? Are they proprietary? If so, who invests in them, and why?</li>
<li>Describe how the work appears across formats, from print and analog to electronic and digital. What changes across these appearances? What features are added or lost? How does the format shape experience and meaning?</li>
<li>Account for who is maintaining the work, where, and how. What expertise is required? What sort of technologies and facilities are necessary to maintain the work? What’s the near future (next 20 years) of the work in its current format? The distant future (50 years from now)?</li>
<li>Describe the ephemeral dimensions of the work. What aspects of it resist storage or preservation? Why might its ephemerality (or what cannot be recorded or captured) be important?</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintenance prompts considerations of <em>persistence and obsolescence</em>.</p>
<p>This section brings me to the fourth key point of this chapter: <em>Synthesizing how you comprehend and apprehend a work considers how it was made (process over product), what’s meta about it (design and structure), what it means (significance), how it massages or manipulates people’s senses (discipline and pleasure), how people move with it (agency and anticipation), what motivates people to attend and return to it (traction), how it morphs or changes shape (mutability), and how it is or will be maintained (persistence and obsolescence).</em></p>

<p>As you evaluate your comprehension and apprehension of a work, you may want to consider how it mediates its relation to power and “common sense,” which includes norms, assumed knowledge, and congealed ways of perceiving.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to approach mediation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the values, ways of living, and ways of perceiving the work takes for granted. When and why does it assume you agree with it? What does it assume you or the characters already know? How does it rationalize or make sense of experience and perception?</li>
<li>Describe what the work considers to be interesting. On what does it focus? What does it foreground or centre? What does it ignore?</li>
<li>Describe what the work considers to be subversive. What norms does it resist or reject? How does it “speak back” to power? How is it powerful?</li>
<li>Describe whom and what the work is addressing. Who is included in the intended audience? Excluded? What social, cultural, or political issues does it engage, either directly or indirectly? By whom and for whom was it made?</li>
<li>Describe how the work builds or projects a world. What makes it run? What are its laws or boundaries? Its mythologies or shared stories?</li>
<li>Describe what’s immediate in the work. What happens instantly or without friction? What’s considered to be natural or commonplace?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mediation prompts considerations of <em>ideals and worldviews</em>.</p>

<p>You may want to consider whom and what the work misses, overlooks, or essentializes.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to approach this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe characters and character experiences you’d expect to be a part of the work. What characters and experiences are absent? Why do you think that’s the case?</li>
<li>Describe when and how characterization in the work strikes you as stereotypical, hyperbolic (caricature), or problematic. What motivates these representations?</li>
<li>Describe what kind of interactions or features you’d expect to be a part of the work. What interactions or features are absent? Why do you think that’s the case?</li>
<li>Describe the work’s use of detail. What’s absent or not quite what you’d expect? Why do you think that’s the case?</li>
<li>Describe the consistency of the work, including consistency of its characters, plots, devices, settings, actions, and objects. What changes, or is missing, from scene to scene, moment to moment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking whom and what the work misses prompts considerations of <em>continuity and representation</em>.</p>

<p>You may want to consider the memories the work elicits and how it elicits them.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to approach this question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe how time is treated or imagined in the work. How is it constructed? How is it set or associated with particular spaces? How do characters experience it? Where and when are their memories triggered? When isn’t time “empty” or “homogeneous”? That is, when is it something more than clocks and calendars?</li>
<li>Describe how time is apprehended in the work. What’s your experience of its treatment of time and how it engages the past, present, and future? What does the work ask you to remember, or what does it assume you recall? What moments does it ask you to imagine?</li>
<li>Describe the personal or cultural memories the work elicits or stimulates. Which moments in the work seem familiar or feel intimate? Which moments prompt reflection? Which strike you as singular or unique to the work? Which moments seem real, like they draw upon events from actual history that a group experienced in the past?</li>
<li>Describe how the work relies on particular media and sensory experiences to point to the past and future. What’s presented as a record or evidence? As fact? As speculation? What’s repeated? What’s ephemeral? What’s forgotten? What’s drawn from an archive, museum, diary, private collection, or history book?</li>
<li>Describe how the work functions as an act of witnessing, or prompts you to witness accounts of an event. What moments are being witnessed, by whom, and to what effects? What’s presented as (auto)biographical? What makes the author an authority on the topic? Whose stories are they sharing, with whose permission, and under what assumptions?</li>
<li>Describe how the work unfolds or progresses. How does time function in the work? What’s the sequence of events, and how is that sequence structured? Are events presented chronologically? When and why do narrators and characters flash-forward (prolepsis) or flash-back (analepsis)? How does the work’s treatment of time contribute to feelings of closure or a sense of resolution? How much control do you feel, or wish to feel, over the work’s media and the timing of its narrative? Would you say it has a rhythm or beat?</li>
</ul>
<p>Memories, or acts of remembering, prompt considerations of <em>retrieval, recollection, and forgetting</em>, including the material dimensions, embodied experiences, and craft of time in a work.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You may also want to consider the role of mimesis in the work.</p>
<p>Here are some ways to approach mimesis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe how the work shows and tells. What does the narrator say? What do the characters say? What’s described as fact? As experience? What’s treated as information? What’s alluded to? What’s symbolic? Poetic? What pictures are painted? When and why does something have multiple, if not contradictory, meanings? What’s direct about the work, and what’s indirect? What roles do audio, image, and text play in apprehending and comprehending what’s direct and indirect?</li>
<li>Describe how the work “holds a mirror up to nature.” How does the work represent or reproduce reality? Comment on it? How does it project a world? How does it build its own? How aware is it of the media it uses? How “meta” is it? What’s imitated? What’s warped or exaggerated? What’s fabricated? How compelling or “true to life” are the fabrications?</li>
<li>Describe how the work invites immersion and criticism. What’s cathartic about it? What draws you into it and sustains your attention? What pleases you about it? What concerns you about it? How does it distract you? How does it invite you to play a role, and how do you feel about that experience? What does it want you to treat as fact or truth? As fabrication or falsity? How do fabrication and fact overlap in the work? What does it look at, stand above, or examine from afar? What does it meander or stroll through? When and how is it intimate? Sincere? Ironic? Reflexive? Judgmental? What does it politicize, and what does it aestheticize? How?</li>
</ul>
<p>Mimesis prompts considerations of how <em>boundaries</em> are drawn between inside and outside, close and distant.</p>
<p>This section brings me to the fifth key point of this chapter: <em>Evaluating your comprehension and apprehension of a work considers how the work mediates its relation to power and common sense (ideals and worldviews), what and whom it misses (continuity and representation), the memories the work elicits and how (retrieval, recollection, and forgetting), and the role of mimesis in the work (boundaries).</em></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>An apparatus helps to measure and produce relations that influence how people sense and make sense of media and fiction. These relations may be described through frameworks (such as grids ands stacks) or prepositions (like “at” for spectacle or “to” for address).</li>
<li>Apprehending a work considers the role that materials (stuff or substance), sensory modalities (including attention), and mood (such as feelings of distance, immediacy, and familiarity) play in media and fiction.</li>
<li>Comprehending a work considers the role that modules (relationships between parts and whole), measurement (including the production of value), the main content (shared interpretations), and the moment (shared situations) play in media and fiction.</li>
<li>Synthesizing how you comprehend and apprehend a work considers how it was made (process over product), what’s meta about it (design and structure), what it means (significance), how it massages or manipulates people’s senses (discipline and pleasure), how people move with it (agency and anticipation), what motivates people to attend and return to it (traction), how it morphs or changes shape (mutability), and how it is or will be maintained (persistence and obsolescence).</li>
